Numpy
Introduction to Numpy
Numpy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a comprehensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Key Concepts and Features
Arrays: The core data structure in Numpy is the ndarray, which is a multi-dimensional array of elements, all of the same type.
Operations: Numpy provides efficient array computations with element-wise operations, broadcasting, slicing, and indexing.
Mathematical Functions: Numpy includes a variety of mathematical functions for tasks like linear algebra, Fourier transform, statistics, and random number generation.
Performance: Numpy arrays are more memory-efficient and faster than Python lists, making Numpy ideal for numerical and scientific computing.
Example Code
Creating Numpy arrays:

import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Create a 2D array
arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
Performing operations on arrays:

# Element-wise addition
result = arr1 + arr1

# Matrix multiplication
result = np.dot(arr2, arr2.T)
Pandas
Introduction to Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis built on top of Numpy. It provides high-level data structures and functions designed for working with structured data, such as tables and time series.

Key Features
Data Structures: Pandas introduces Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional) data structures, which can hold different data types.
Data Operations: Pandas facilitates data cleaning, transformation, and analysis through functionalities like indexing, selection, filtering, merging, and grouping.
Handling Missing Data: Tools for handling missing data include filling (fillna()), dropping (dropna()), and interpolation.
IO Tools: Supports reading and writing data from various file formats such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and JSON.
Example Code
Creating a DataFrame:

import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35],
        'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
Performing operations on DataFrame:


# Selecting rows and columns
df_filtered = df[df['Age'] > 30]

# Grouping and aggregation
grouped_data = df.groupby('City').mean()
