Assignment1:
Understanding Git: Write a concise explanation of what Git is, its purpose in version control, and why it is widely used in software development.

Git vs. GitHub: Explain the difference between Git and GitHub. Why is GitHub a valuable platform for collaborative software development?

Git Basics: Create a new Git repository on your local machine. Initialize it with a README file and make your first commit. Provide a screenshot of your Git commands and the resulting commit history.



What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It tracks changes to files over time, enabling multiple developers to collaborate on a project without interfering with each other's work.

Purpose of Git in Version Control
Git allows developers to:

Track changes to files over time.
Revert to previous versions when needed.
Collaborate efficiently on projects.
Manage different versions and branches of code.
Why Git is Widely Used
Git's popularity in software development is due to:

Branching and Merging: Supports flexible workflows with powerful branching and merging capabilities.
Distributed System: Each developer has a full copy of the repository, enabling offline work and better collaboration.
Speed: Fast operations such as commits, branching, and merging.
Community Support: Extensive community and resources for support and tool integration.

Git vs. GitHub:

Git:

Definition: Version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
Functionality: Operates locally on developer machines, managing changes, branches, merges, and repositories.

GitHub:

Definition: Cloud-based hosting service for managing Git repositories online.
Functionality: Provides web-based graphical interface, access control, bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for projects.
Value for Collaborative Development: Facilitates collaboration with features like pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, and project management tools.
Git Basics: Creating a New Git Repository
Step-by-Step Instructions:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project:


cd /path/to/your/directory
Run the following commands:


# Step 1: Create a new directory for your project

mkdir MyProject
cd MyProject

# Step 2: Initialize a new Git repository

git init

# Step 3: Create a README file

echo "# MyProject" > README.md

# Step 4: Add the README file to the staging area

git add README.md

# Step 5: Commit the README file to the repository

git commit -m "Initial commit with README"
View the commit history:
